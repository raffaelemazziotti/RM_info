<h2>About</h2>
<p class="justified">My career began in Experimental Psychology at the University of Florence,
    where I worked on a behavioural tasks to measure how mice recognise and remember visual
    scenes. This curiosity about the maturing visual system led me to a PhD in Basic and
    Developmental Neuroscience at the University of Pisa, where I focused on the microRNA
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15488" target="_blank" class="about-img-link">miR‑132
    </a>, whose expression is shaped by visual experience; we found it is indispensable for normal
    depth perception. In parallel, I built a
    <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2015/11/16/a-low-cost-approach-to-intrinsic-optical-signal/"
       target="_blank" class="about-img-link">low‑cost optical‑imaging platform</a> that turns rapid
    changes in cortical blood flow into clear read‑outs of brain activity. Using this tool in a mouse model
    of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/26/12/2290/3091880" target="_blank"
          class="about-img-link">CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder</a>, we uncovered weakened visual responses
    and trained an AI system that can quantify disease severity and track the effects of emerging therapies.
    Recognising the power of advanced analytics, I completed an
    <a href="https://masterbigdata.it/" target="_blank" class="about-img-link">
        international master’s programme</a> in Data Science, developing a cross‑species
    <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/5/ENEURO.0122-21.2021" target="_blank" class="about-img-link">deep‑learning model
    </a> to analyse subtle shifts in pupil dynamics and reveal how sensory information is processed
    in both animals and humans. Today I combine behaviour, electrophysiology, and functional
    near‑infrared spectroscopy to investigate neurovascular signatures of autism and other
    neurodevelopmental disorders in laboratory models and patients. My goal remains constant:
    to merge experimental psychology with the tools provided by neurobiology,
    transforming foundational insights into biomarkers that can guide new treatments for neurodevelopmental
    disorders.</p>
