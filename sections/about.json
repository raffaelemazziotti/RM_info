This curiosity about the maturing visual system led me to a PhD in Basic and Developmental Neuroscience at the University of Pisa, where I focused on the microRNA <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15488\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about-img-link\">miR‑132</a>, whose expression is guided by visual experience; we found it is indispensable for normal depth perception. In parallel, I built a <a href=\"http://www.in.cnr.it/index.php/it/12-projects/198-imaging\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about-img-link\">low‑cost optical‑imaging platform</a> that turns rapid changes in cortical blood flow into clear read‑outs of brain activity. Using this tool in a mouse model of <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/26/12/2290/3091880\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about-img-link\">CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder</a>, we uncovered weakened visual responses and trained an AI system that can quantify disease severity and track the effects of emerging therapies. Recognising the power of advanced analytics, I completed an <a href=\"https://masterbigdata.it/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about-img-link\">advanced master’s programme</a> in Data Science, developing a cross‑species <a href=\"https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/5/ENEURO.0122-21.2021\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about-img-link\">deep‑learning model</a> to analyse subtle shifts in pupil dynamics and reveal how sensory information is processed in both animals and humans. Today I combine behaviour, electrophysiology, and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-01820-5\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about-img-link\">functional near‑infrared spectroscopy</a> to investigate neurovascular signatures of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders in laboratory models and patients. My goal remains constant: to merge experimental psychology with the tools provided by neurobiology, transforming foundational insights into biomarkers that can guide new treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>"
